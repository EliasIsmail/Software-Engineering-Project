	 * Note that the constructor is apparently never called, but there are no null
	 * pointer exceptions regarding that libraryApp is not set. When creating the
	 * BookSteps object, the Cucumber libraries are using that constructor with an
	 * object of class LibraryApp as the default.
	 * 
	 * This also holds for all other step classes that have a similar constructor.
	 * In this case, the <b>same</b> object of class LibraryApp is used as an
	 * argument. This provides an easy way of sharing the same object, in this case
	 * the object of class LibraryApp, among all step classes.
	 * 
	 * This principle is called <em>dependency injection</em>. More information can
	 * be found in the "Cucumber for Java" book available online from the DTU Library.
